         <h2>First Nepalese female ascent</h2>
         <p>It has been 29 years since Pasang Lhamu Sherpa climbed the world's highest peak, Mount Everest. She climbed Mt. Everest on 22 April, 1993, representing all Nepali women.
         Earlier, in 1975, Junko Tabei, a Japanese woman, became the first woman to climb Mt Everest. However, no Nepalese woman had achieved this feat back then. In this connection, Pasang Lhamu did not dare to climb Mt. Everest.
         Pasang Lhamu was born in the district of Solukhumbu on 16 December, 1961. As a child, she started trekking in the mountains following her father, Late Phurvakitar Sherpa. Later, when she became an owner of a trekking company, her love for mountains grew. In this process, she had even climbed some mountains at home and abroad like Mount Cho Oyu, Yala Peak, Pisang and Mount Blanc.</p>
